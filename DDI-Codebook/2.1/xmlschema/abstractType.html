                        nature, and scope of the data collection, special characteristics of its
                        contents, major subject areas covered, and what questions the PIs attempted
                        to answer when they conducted the study. A listing of major variables in the
                        study is important here. In cases where a codebook contains more than one
                        abstract (for example, one might be supplied by the data producer and
                        another prepared by the data archive where the data are deposited), the
                        "source" and "date" attributes may be used to distinguish the abstract
                        versions. Maps to Dublin Core Description element. Inclusion of this element
                        in the codebook is recommended. The "date" attribute should follow ISO
                        convention of YYYY-MM-DD.</p></div><div style="padding-left:25px;"><p><em>Example(s):</em></p><pre>&lt;abstract date="1999-01-28" source="ICPSR"&gt; Data on labor force activity for the week prior 
to the survey are supplied in this collection. Information is available on the employment status, 
occupation, and industry of persons 15 years old and over. Demographic variables such as age, sex, 
race, marital status, veteran status, household relationship, educational background, and Hispanic 
origin are included. In addition to providing these core data, the May survey also contains a supplement 
on work schedules for all applicable persons aged 15 years and older who were employed at the time of 
the survey. This supplement focuses on shift work, flexible hours, and work at home for both main and 
second jobs.&lt;/abstract&gt; </pre></div></body></html>
