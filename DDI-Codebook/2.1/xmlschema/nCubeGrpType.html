                        <p>A group of nCubes that may share a common subject, arise from the
                            interpretation of a single question, or are linked by some other factor.
                            This element makes it possible to identify all nCubes derived from a
                            simple presentation table, and to provide the original table title and
                            universe, as well as reference the source. Specific nesting patterns can
                            be described using the attribute nCubeGrp. </p>
                        <p>nCube groups are also created this way in order to permit nCubes to
                            belong to multiple groups, including multiple subject groups, without
                            causing overlapping groups. nCubes that are linked by the same use of
                            the same variable need not be identified by an nCubeGrp element because
                            they are already linked by a common variable element. Note that as a
                            result of the strict sequencing required by XML, all nCube Groups must
                            be marked up before the Variable element is opened. That is, the mark-up
                            author cannot mark up a nCube Group, then mark up its constituent
                            nCubes, then mark up another nCube Group. </p>
                        <p>The "type" attribute refers to the general type of grouping of the
                            nCubes. Specific nCube Groups, included within the 'type' attribute,
                            are: </p>
                        <p>Display: nCubes that are part of the same presentation table. </p>
                        <p>Subject: nCubes that address a common topic or subject, e.g., income,
                            poverty, children. </p>
                        <p>Iteration: nCubes that appear in different sections of the data file
                            measuring a common subject in different ways, e.g., using different
                            universes, units of measurement, etc. </p>
                        <p>Pragmatic: An nCube group without shared properties. </p>
                        <p>Record: nCubes from a single record in a hierarchical file. </p>
                        <p>File: nCube from a single file in a multifile study.</p>
                        <p>Other: nCubes that do not fit easily into any of the categories
                            listed above, e.g., a group of nCubes whose documentation is in another
                            language. </p>
                        <p>The "nCube" attribute is used to reference all the IDs of the nCubes
                            belonging to the group. </p>
                        <p>The "nCubeGrp" attribute is used to reference all the subsidiary
                            nCube groups which nest underneath the current nCubeGrp. This allows for
                            encoding of a hierarchical structure of nCube groups. </p>
                        <p>The attribute "name" provides a name, or short label, for the group. </p>
                        <p>The "sdatrefs" are summary data description references that record
                            the ID values of all elements within the summary data description
                            section of the Study Description that might apply to the group. These
                            elements include: time period covered, date of collection, nation or
                            country, geographic coverage, geographic unit, unit of analysis,
                            universe, and kind of data. </p>
                        <p>The "methrefs" are methodology and processing references which record
                            the ID values of all elements within the study methodology and
                            processing section of the Study Description which might apply to the
                            group. These elements include information on data collection and data
                            appraisal (e.g., sampling, sources, weighting, data cleaning, response
                            rates, and sampling error estimates). </p>
                        <p>The "pubrefs" attribute provides a link to publication/citation
                            references and records the ID values of all citations elements within
                            Section 2.5 or Section 5.0 that pertain to this nCube group. </p>
                        <p>The "access" attribute records the ID values of all elements in
                            Section 2.4 of the document that describe access conditions for this
                            nCube group. </p>
