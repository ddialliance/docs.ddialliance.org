has been added to this marked-up version of the documentation.&lt;/notes&gt;&lt;/verStmt&gt;&lt;/docDscr&gt;

&lt;docDscr&gt;&lt;citation&gt;&lt;notes resp="Jane Smith"&gt;This citation was prepared by the archive 
based on information received from the markup authors.&lt;/notes&gt;&lt;/citation&gt;&lt;/docDscr&gt; 

&lt;docSrc&gt;&lt;verStmt&gt;&lt;notes resp="Jane Smith"&gt;The source codebook was produced from  
original hardcopy materials using  Optical Character Recognition (OCR).&lt;/notes&gt;&lt;verStmt&gt;
&lt;/docSrc&gt; 

&lt;docSrc&gt;&lt;notes&gt;A machine-readable version of the source codebook was supplied by the 
Zentralarchiv&lt;/notes&gt;&lt;/docSrc&gt;

&lt;docDscr&gt;&lt;notes&gt;This Document Description, or header information, can be used  within an 
electronic resource discovery environment.&lt;/notes&gt;&lt;/docDscr&gt; 

&lt;stdyDscr&gt;&lt;verStmt&gt;&lt;notes resp="Jane Smith"&gt;Data for 1998 have been added to this 
version of the data collection.&lt;/notes&gt;&lt;/verStmt&gt;&lt;/stdyDscr&gt;

&lt;stdyDscr&gt;&lt;citation&gt;&lt;notes resp="Jane Smith"&gt;This citation was sent to ICPSR by the 
agency depositing the data.&lt;/notes&gt;&lt;/citation&gt;&lt;/stdyDscr&gt; 

&lt;stdyInfo&gt;&lt;notes&gt;Data on employment and income refer to the preceding year, although 
demographic data refer to the time of the survey.&lt;/notes&gt;&lt;/stdyInfo&gt; 

&lt;method&gt;&lt;notes&gt;Undocumented codes were found in this data collection. Missing data are 
represented by blanks.&lt;/notes&gt;&lt;/method&gt;

&lt;method&gt;&lt;notes&gt;For this collection, which focuses on employment, unemployment, and 
gender equality, data from EUROBAROMETER 44.3: HEALTH CARE ISSUES AND PUBLIC SECURITY, 
FEBRUARY-APRIL 1996 (ICPSR 6752) were merged with an oversample.&lt;/notes&gt;&lt;/method&gt; 

&lt;setAvail&gt;&lt;notes&gt; Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics used in the analyses for the 
final report are not provided as part of this collection.&lt;/notes&gt;&lt;/setAvail&gt; 

&lt;dataAccs&gt;&lt;notes&gt;Users should note that this is a beta version of the data. The 
investigators therefore request that users who encounter any problems with the dataset 
contact them at the above address.&lt;/notes&gt;&lt;/dataAccs&gt; 

&lt;fileStrc&gt;&lt;notes&gt;The number of arrest records for an individual is dependent on the 
number of arrests an offender had.&lt;/notes&gt;&lt;/fileStrc&gt; 

&lt;fileTxt&gt;&lt;verStmt&gt;&lt;notes&gt;Data for all previously-embargoed variables are now available 
in  this version of the file.&lt;/notes&gt;&lt;/verStmt&gt;&lt;/fileTxt&gt; 

&lt;fileDscr&gt;&lt;notes&gt;There is a restricted version of this file containing confidential 
information,  access to which is controlled by the principal investigator.&lt;/notes&gt;
&lt;/fileDscr&gt; 

&lt;varGrp&gt;&lt;notes&gt;This variable group was created for the purpose of combining all derived 
variables.&lt;/notes&gt;&lt;/varGrp&gt; 

&lt;varGrp&gt;&lt;notes source="archive" resp="John Data"&gt;This variable group and all other 
variable groups in this data file were organized according to a schema developed by 
the adhoc advisory committee. &lt;/notes&gt;&lt;/varGrp&gt; 

&lt;nCubeGrp&gt;&lt;notes&gt;This nCube Group was created for the purpose of presenting a cross-
tabulation between variables "Tenure" and "Age of householder."&lt;/notes&gt;&lt;/nCubeGrp&gt; 

&lt;valrng&gt;&lt;notes subject="political party"&gt;Starting with Euro-Barometer 2 the coding of 
this variable has been standardized following an approximate ordering of each country's 
political parties along a "left" to "right" continuum in the first digit of the codes. 
Parties coded 01-39 are generally considered on the "left", those coded 40-49 in the 
"center", and those coded 60-89 on the "right" of the political spectrum. Parties coded 
50-59 cannot be readily located in the traditional meaning of "left" and "right". The 
second digit of the codes is not significant to the "left-right" ordering. Codes 90-99 
contain the response "other party" and various missing data responses. Users may modify 
these codings or part of these codings in order to suit their specific needs. &lt;/notes&gt;
&lt;/valrng&gt; 

&lt;invalrng&gt;&lt;notes&gt;Codes 90-99 contain the response "other party" and various missing 
data responses. &lt;/notes&gt;&lt;/invalrng&gt; 

&lt;var&gt;&lt;verStmt&gt;&lt;notes&gt;The labels for categories 01 and 02 for this variable, were 
inadvertently switched in the first version of this variable and have now been 
corrected.&lt;/notes&gt;&lt;/verStmt&gt;&lt;/var&gt; 

&lt;var&gt;&lt;notes&gt;This variable was created by recoding location of residence to Census 
regions.&lt;/notes&gt;&lt;/var&gt; 

&lt;nCube&gt;&lt;verStmt&gt;&lt;notes&gt;The labels for categories 01 and 02 in dimension 1 were 
inadvertently switched in the first version of the cube, and have now been corrected.
&lt;/notes&gt;&lt;/verStmt&gt;&lt;/nCube&gt; 

&lt;nCube&gt;&lt;notes&gt;This nCube was created to meet the needs of local low income programs 
in determining eligibility for federal funds.&lt;/notes&gt;&lt;/nCube&gt; 

&lt;dataDscr&gt;&lt;notes&gt;The variables in this study are identical to earlier waves. &lt;/notes&gt;
&lt;/dataDscr&gt; 

&lt;otherMat&gt;&lt;notes&gt;Users should be aware that this questionnaire was modified  during 
the CAI process.&lt;/notes&gt;&lt;/otherMat&gt; </pre></div></body></html>
