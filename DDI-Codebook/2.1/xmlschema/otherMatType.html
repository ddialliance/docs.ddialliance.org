                        <p>This section allows for the inclusion of other materials that are
                            related to the study as identified and labeled by the DTD/Schema users
                            (encoders). The' materials may be entered as PCDATA (ASCII text)
                            directly into the document (through use of the "txt" element). This
                            ection may also serve as a "container" for other electronic materials
                            such as setup files by providing a brief description of the
                            study-related materials accompanied by the attributes "type" and "level"
                            defining the material further. The "URI" attribute may be used to
                            indicate the location of the other study-related materials.</p>
                        <p>Other Study-Related Materials may include: questionnaires, coding
                            notes, SPSS/SAS/Stata setup files (and others), user manuals, continuity
                            guides, sample computer software programs, glossaries of terms,
                            interviewer/project instructions, maps, database schema, data
                            dictionaries, show cards, coding information, interview schedules,
                            missing values information, frequency files, variable maps, etc.</p>
                        <p>Note that Section 2.5, Other Study Description Materials, should be
                            used for materials that are primarily descriptions of the content and
                            use of the study, such as appendices, sampling information, weighting
                            details, methodological and technical details, publications based upon
                            the study content, related studies or collection of studies, etc. This
                            section, 5.0 Other Study-Related Materials, is intended to include or to
                            link to materials used in the production of the study or useful in the
                            analysis of the study.</p>
                        <p>The "level" attribute is used to clarify the relationship of the
                            other materials to components of the study. Suggested values for level
                            include specifications of the item level to which the element applies:
                            e.g., level=datafile; level=studydsc; level=study. The URI attribute
                            need not be used in every case; it is intended for capturing references
                            to other materials separate from the codebook itself. In Section 5,
                            Other Material is recursively defined.</p>
