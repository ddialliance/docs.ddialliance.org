                        <p>A group of variables that may share a common subject, arise from the
                            interpretation of a single question, or are linked by some other factor. </p>
                        <p>Variable groups are created this way in order to permit variables to
                            belong to multiple groups, including multiple subject groups such as a
                            group of variables on sex and income, or to a subject and a multiple
                            response group, without causing overlapping groups. Variables that are
                            linked by use of the same question need not be identified by a Variable
                            Group element because they are linked by a common unique question
                            identifier in the Variable element. Note that as a result of the strict
                            sequencing required by XML, all Variable Groups must be marked up before
                            the Variable element is opened. That is, the mark-up author cannot mark
                            up a Variable Group, then mark up its constituent variables, then mark
                            up another Variable Group.</p>
                        <p>The "type" attribute refers to the general type of grouping of the
                            variables, e.g., subject, multiple response. </p>
                        <p>Specific variable groups, included within the "type" attribute, are: </p>
                        <p>Section: Questions which derive from the same section of the
                            questionnaire, e.g., all variables located in Section C.</p>
                        <p>Multiple response: Questions where the respondent has the opportunity
                            to select more than one answer from a variety of choices, e.g., what
                            newspapers have you read in the past month (with the respondent able to
                            select up to five choices). </p>
                        <p>Grid: Sub-questions of an introductory or main question but which do
                            not constitute a multiple response group, e.g., I am going to read you
                            some events in the news lately and you tell me for each one whether you
                            are very interested in the event, fairly interested in the fact, or not
                            interested in the event. </p>
                        <p>Display: Questions which appear on the same interview screen (CAI)
                            together or are presented to the interviewer or respondent as a group. </p>
                        <p>Repetition: The same variable (or group of variables) which are
                            repeated for different groups of respondents or for the same respondent
                            at a different time.</p>
                        <p>Subject: Questions which address a common topic or subject, e.g.,
                            income, poverty, children. </p>
                        <p>Version: Variables, often appearing in pairs, which represent
                            different aspects of the same question, e.g., pairs of variables (or
                            groups) which are adjusted/unadjusted for inflation or season or
                            whatever, pairs of variables with/without missing data imputed, and
                            versions of the same basic question. </p>
                        <p>Iteration: Questions that appear in different sections of the data
                            file measuring a common subject in different ways, e.g., a set of
                            variables which report the progression of respondent income over the
                            life course. </p>
                        <p>Analysis: Variables combined into the same index, e.g., the
                            components of a calculation, such as the numerator and the denominator
                            of an economic statistic. </p>
                        <p>Pragmatic: A variable group without shared properties. </p>
                        <p>Record: Variable from a single record in a hierarchical file. </p>
                        <p>File: Variable from a single file in a multifile study. </p>
                        <p>Randomized: Variables generated by CAI surveys produced by one or
                            more random number variables together with a response variable, e.g,
                            random variable X which could equal 1 or 2 (at random) which in turn
                            would control whether Q.23 is worded "men" or "women", e.g., would you
                            favor helping [men/women] laid off from a factory obtain training for a
                            new job? </p>
                        <p>Other: Variables which do not fit easily into any of the categories
                            listed above, e.g., a group of variables whose documentation is in
                            another language. </p>
                        <p>The "var" attribute is used to reference all the constituent variable
                            IDs in the group. </p>
                        <p>The "varGrp" attribute is used to reference all the subsidiary
                            variable groups which nest underneath the current varGrp. This allows
                            for encoding of a hierarchical structure of variable groups. </p>
                        <p>The attribute "name" provides a name, or short label, for the group. </p>
                        <p>The "sdatrefs" are summary data description references that record
                            the ID values of all elements within the summary data description
                            section of the Study Description that might apply to the group. These
                            elements include: time period covered, date of collection, nation or
                            country, geographic coverage, geographic unit, unit of analysis,
                            universe, and kind of data. </p>
                        <p>The "methrefs" are methodology and processing references which record
                            the ID values of all elements within the study methodology and
                            processing section of the Study Description which might apply to the
                            group. These elements include information on data collection and data
                            appraisal (e.g., sampling, sources, weighting, data cleaning, response
                            rates, and sampling error estimates). </p>
                        <p>The "pubrefs" attribute provides a link to publication/citation
                            references and records the ID values of all citations elements within
                            Section 2.5 or Section 5.0 that pertain to this variable group. </p>
                        <p>The "access" attribute records the ID values of all elements in
                            Section 2.4 of the document that describe access conditions for this
                            variable group. </p>
