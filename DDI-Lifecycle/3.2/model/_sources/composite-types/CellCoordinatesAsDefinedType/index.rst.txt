CellCoordinatesAsDefinedType
----------------------------

Defines one or more cells by defining the applicable values of each dimension as "all values", a "specific value" or a range. For example in a simple 2 dimensional grid where dimension rank-1 is displayed as rows and dimension rank-2 as columns and the first column contains a NumericDomain; SelectDimension rank="1" allValues="true" and SelectDimension rank="2" specificValue="1" would result in the NumericDomain being attached to the first column of the grid only.
