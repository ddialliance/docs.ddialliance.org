   "Difference",":doc:`/composite-types/StructuredStringType/index`","0..1","A description of the differences between the two items using a StructuredString to support multiple language versions of the same content as well as optional formatting of the content."
   "CommonalityTypeCoded",":doc:`/composite-types/CodeValueType/index`","0..1","A brief description describing the commonality of the two schemes/items, i.e., ""Identical"", ""High"", ""Medium"", ""Low"", ""None"". Supports the use of an external controlled vocabulary."
   "CommonalityWeight","float","0..1","A value between 0 and 1 expressing the degree of commonality (0 indicates none, 1 indicates that they are identical)."
   "UserDefinedCorrespondenceProperty",":doc:`/composite-types/StandardKeyValuePairType/index`","0..n","An alternate means of expressing commonality within a specific system. A system specific user defined correspondence expressed as a key/value pair. As this is specific to an individual system the use of controlled vocabularies for the key is strongly recommended."
