CoverageType
------------

Describes the temporal, spatial and topical coverage. At the instance level these descriptions should be inclusive of the coverage of all modules in the instance. The element is available within individual modules and can be used to refine the coverage to that of the individual module.

In the case of a physical instance, the RestrictionProcess would be the same as a case, record or variable selection process."
   "IsRestrictionOfParentCoverage","boolean","0..1","If the coverage described within this object is a restriction of the coverage of its parent study or group set this attribute to ""true"". If the coverage of a specific type (spatial, topical, or temporal) is not a restriction, include this coverage type by reference to that described in parent. Create a new coverage for the type being restricted."
