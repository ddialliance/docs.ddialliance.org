   "CodeDomain",":doc:`/composite-types/CodeDomainType/index`","0..1","This includes a reference to a CodeList that is used for the labels contained in the dimension. CodeLists are used even when the code is not being displayed in order to use this information for creating the cell coordinate address."
   "Roster",":doc:`/composite-types/RosterType/index`","0..1","A roster is an unlabeled list of numbered rows or columns depending upon orientation. The numbers may or may not be displayed but will be used as information for creating the cell coordinate address."

Provides coordinate order (1,2,n) for the intersect point of this dimension within the cell address. For example, if the rank of this dimension is 2, the intersect point on this dimension will be the second value listed in the cell address."
   "DisplayCode","boolean","0..1","If set to ""true"" (default value) the code value associated with the category label will be displayed. Set to ""false"" if only the category label should be displayed."
