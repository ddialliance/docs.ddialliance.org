GrossFileStructureType
----------------------

Includes information about the file structure, as well as other characteristics that are specific to the physical instance. Information includes place of production, processing checks to validate the content, processing status, the software used to create the data file, and check sums for the number of cases and overall record count.

   "PlaceOfProduction","string","0..1","Indicates the place where the physical instance was produced expressed as a simple string."
   "ProcessingCheck",":doc:`/composite-types/StructuredStringType/index`","0..n","Documents processing checks and other operations performed on the data file."
   "ProcessingStatus",":doc:`/composite-types/CodeValueType/index`","0..1","Processing status of the data file. Supports the use of an external controlled vocabulary."
   "CreationSoftware",":doc:`/composite-types/SoftwareType/index`","0..1","Indicates the software that was used to create the data file."
   "CaseQuantity","int","0..1","Number of cases or observations in the data file. Caution in using optional checksums is recommended. Conflict between checksums and the items being counted can cause problems with warning flags during processing. If using checksum to capture information for internal processing purposes, the use of automatically generated check sums is strongly urged."
   "OverallRecordCount","int","0..1","Overall record count in the data file. Caution in using optional checksums is recommended. Conflict between checksums and the items being counted can cause problems with warning flags during processing. If using checksum to capture information for internal processing purposes, the use of automatically generated check sums is strongly urged."

   "URN","string","1..1",""
   "Agency","string","1..1",""
   "ID","string","1..1",""
   "Version","string","1..1",""
   "UserID",":doc:`/composite-types/UserIDType/index`","0..n","Allows for the specification of identifiers other than the specified DDI identification of the object. This may be a legacy ID from DDI-C, a system specific ID such as for a database or registry, or a non-DDI unique identifier. As the identifier is specific to a system the system must be identified with the UserID structure."
   "InheritanceAction","string","0..1","The attribute ""action"" is used for inheritance situations where there is an override at the local level (within a grouped StudyUnit) which is not available for further inheritance. There are three possible values for ""action"": Add - A new identifiable object (an Identifiable, Versionable, or Maintainable element) is provided locally with a new identifier (one that is not inherited). All properties (elements and attributes contained in the object) of the object are as specified. If an object with an existing id is created, this is an error.; Update - An object is provided locally with the SAME id as the inherited object. For each type of property that is specified locally, a full set of those properties is specified for local use. These properties replace any properties of this type which were inherited. Unspecified properties are used as inherited.; Delete - An object is provided locally with the SAME id as the inherited object. All properties specified locally in this object will be deleted if their types and values match those inherited. Note that to completely delete an object at the local level, all properties of the inherited object must be listed."
