LifecycleEventType
------------------

Documents an event in the life cycle of a study or group of studies. A life cycle event can be any event which is judged to be significant enough to document by the agency maintaining the documentation for a particular set of data. The element EventType indicates the type of event, using a typology meaningful to the documenter.

   "EventType",":doc:`/composite-types/CodeValueType/index`","0..1","Indicates the type of event, using a typology meaningful to the documenter. Supports the use of a controlled vocabulary."

   "AgencyOrganizationReference",":doc:`/item-types/Organization/index`","0..n","Reference to an organization or individual, defined in the organization scheme, responsible for the life cycle event."
   "Description",":doc:`/composite-types/StructuredStringType/index`","0..1","A description of the event such as what the event included, its importance, or other significant information. Structure supports the use of multiple languages."
   "Relationship",":doc:`/composite-types/RelationshipType/index`","0..n","Allows linking a lifecycle event to one or more sections of metadata. If no relationship is noted the lifecycle event relates to its full parent StudyUnit, Group, or Resource Package."

This may be a legacy ID from DDI-C, a system specific ID such as for a database or registry, or a non-DDI unique identifier. As the identifier is specific to a system the system must be identified with the UserID structure."
   "InheritanceAction","string","0..1","The attribute ""action"" is used for inheritance situations where there is an override at the local level (within a grouped StudyUnit) which is not available for further inheritance. There are three possible values for ""action"": Add - A new identifiable object (an Identifiable, Versionable, or Maintainable element) is provided locally with a new identifier (one that is not inherited). All properties (elements and attributes contained in the object) of the object are as specified. If an object with an existing id is created, this is an error.; Update - An object is provided locally with the SAME id as the inherited object. For each type of property that is specified locally, a full set of those properties is specified for local use. These properties replace any properties of this type which were inherited. Unspecified properties are used as inherited.; Delete - An object is provided locally with the SAME id as the inherited object. All properties specified locally in this object will be deleted if their types and values match those inherited. Note that to completely delete an object at the local level, all properties of the inherited object must be listed."
