.. csv-table::

   :widths: 15,10,5,100

   "Text",":doc:`/composite-types/TextType/index`","0..1","The value of the static text string. Supports the optional use of XHTML formatting tags within the string structure. If the content of a literal text contains more than one language, i.e. ""What is your understanding of the German word 'Gesundheit'?"", the foreign language element should be placed in a separate LiteralText component with the appropriate xml:lang value and, in this case, isTranslatable set to ""false"". If the existence of white space is critical to the understanding of the content (such as inclusion of a leading or trailing white space), set the attribute of Text xml:space to ""preserve""."
