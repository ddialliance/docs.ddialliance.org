LocationRepresentationBaseType
------------------------------

Means of describing the Location of an action and the action itself within a repesentation so that they can be used by questions as a response domain. In addition to the basic objects of the representation, the structure briefly describes the object type upon which the action is to take place and the action to take (where an how to mark the object).

   "MissingValue","string","0..1","List the values used to represent missing data in a space delimited array. Use of MissingValuesReference is preferred. If this content does not match the values provided in the MissingValuesReference, the content of the MissingValuesReference overrides the content of this attribute."
   "BlankIsMissingValue","boolean","0..1","When value is true a blank or empty variable content should be treated as a missing value.  Use of MissingValuesReference is preferred."
