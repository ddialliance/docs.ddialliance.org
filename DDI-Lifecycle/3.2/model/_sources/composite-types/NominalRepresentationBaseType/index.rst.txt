NominalRepresentationBaseType
-----------------------------

A means of capturing the features of a nominal (marked/unmarked) response domain. Note that this is not the same as a code or category list with a yes/no set of responses. This representation is generally used in QuestionGrids when defining the response domain of a grid cell. In addition to the basic objects of a representation, the structure defines the allowed content of the mark using a regular expression.

   "MissingValue","string","0..1","List the values used to represent missing data in a space delimited array. Use of MissingValuesReference is preferred. If this content does not match the values provided in the MissingValuesReference, the content of the MissingValuesReference overrides the content of this attribute."
   "BlankIsMissingValue","boolean","0..1","When value is true a blank or empty variable content should be treated as a missing value.  Use of MissingValuesReference is preferred."
   "ClassificationLevel","string","0..1","Indicates the type of relationship, nominal, ordinal, interval, ratio, or continuous. Use where appropriate for the representation type."
