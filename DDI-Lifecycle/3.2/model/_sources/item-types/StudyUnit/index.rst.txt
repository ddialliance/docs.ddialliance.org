StudyUnit
---------

A primary packaging and publication module within DDI representing the purpose, background, development, data capture, and data products related to a study. In DDI a study is defined as a single coordinated set of data collection/capture activities, such as a one-time survey or a single iteration of a multi-year repeated study (such as one year of a longitudinal survey). The StudyUnit brings together all of the components of the study including the description of its purpose, funding, quality statements, data collection and capture methods and activities, processing activities, and a description of the resulting data (description of its intellectual or logical content plus a description of its physical store). A study unit may have only a single data collection or capture process resulting in one or more data products (i.e., Census). A complex study unit may contain multiple means of data capture that are integrated into one or more data products (i.e., a medical study collecting bio-markers, patient background, health care service information, etc.). A longitudinal study with multiple waves or iterations of data collection is considered to be a group of studies, each wave or iteration captured as a single study unit. As a primary packaging module, the Study Unit contains a full citation, abstract, authorization information, a universe reference, series statement, quality statement, information on post study evaluation, funding information, budget, purpose, coverage, type of analysis units covered, kind of data, other materials, a list of required resource packages, embargoes,  the conceptual components (universe, concept, data element, geographic structure and locations), data collection, logical products, physical data products, physical instance, archive, and DDI profile. The maintainable elements within a Study Unit may be included in-line or by reference.

   "Note",":doc:`/composite-types/NoteType/index`","0..n","Note allows for the attachment of a piece of additional information to any object with an ID. Note facilitates capturing temporary processing notes such as ""Review and approval required"". A single note can be attached to multiple objects by reference to the objects. Note may also contain content for a needed object that has been reported for addition in a later version of the schema. Ideally this should be handled by a local extension, but Note can accommodate run-time extensions when required. The Note should be housed within the Maintainable object that contains the referenced objects. In this way the user is ensured of receiving all known Note attachments when the maintainable content is delivered. This means that if a Note references objects within multiple Maintainable objects, the Note should be repeated in each Maintainable and reference only those objects with that Maintainable."
   "Software",":doc:`/composite-types/SoftwareType/index`","0..n","Indicate the software used to create and/or manage the metadata. This is repeatable to allow for multiple softwares or multiple functions. If this information is important it is advisable to provide it in each maintainable so that it does not become separated from the internal content if the metadata is re-factored."
   "MetadataQuality",":doc:`/composite-types/MetadataQualityType/index`","0..n","An assessment of the quality of the metadata within the Maintainable object, e.g. the quality of the transcription, completeness, editing status, etc."
   "ExternalReferenceDefaultURI","anyURI","0..1","Use to provide a default value for the URI of external references. Use of a URI in a reference within this maintainable overrides the value entered here. Nested maintainables should redeclare the contents of this attribute for clarity."
   "IsPublished","boolean","0..1","Indicates that the maintainable will not be changed without versioning, and is a stable target for referencing."
   "Lang","language","0..1","This is used to designate the language of the metadata content of the maintainable. If a lower level xml:lang attribute conflicts with the content at the maintainable level, the object level value takes precedence."

   "Agency","string","1..1",""
   "ID","string","1..1",""
   "Version","string","1..1",""
   "UserID",":doc:`/composite-types/UserIDType/index`","0..n","Allows for the specification of identifiers other than the specified DDI identification of the object. This may be a legacy ID from DDI-C, a system specific ID such as for a database or registry, or a non-DDI unique identifier. As the identifier is specific to a system the system must be identified with the UserID structure."
   "InheritanceAction","string","0..1","The attribute ""action"" is used for inheritance situations where there is an override at the local level (within a grouped StudyUnit) which is not available for further inheritance. There are three possible values for ""action"": Add - A new identifiable object (an Identifiable, Versionable, or Maintainable element) is provided locally with a new identifier (one that is not inherited). All properties (elements and attributes contained in the object) of the object are as specified. If an object with an existing id is created, this is an error.; Update - An object is provided locally with the SAME id as the inherited object. For each type of property that is specified locally, a full set of those properties is specified for local use. These properties replace any properties of this type which were inherited. Unspecified properties are used as inherited.; Delete - An object is provided locally with the SAME id as the inherited object. All properties specified locally in this object will be deleted if their types and values match those inherited. Note that to completely delete an object at the local level, all properties of the inherited object must be listed."
   "UserAttributePair",":doc:`/composite-types/StandardKeyValuePairType/index`","0..n","A system specific user defined property of the object expressed as a key/value pair. As this is specific to an individual system the use of controlled vocabularies for the key is strongly recommended."
   "VersionResponsibility","string","0..1","Person or organization within the MaintenanceAgency responsible for the version change. If it is important to retain the affiliation between and individual responsible for the version and his/her agency, it may be included in this notation. This is primarily intended for internal use."
   "VersionResponsibilityReference_Organization",":doc:`/item-types/Organization/index`","0..1","Reference person or organization within the MaintenanceAgency responsible for the version change, as described in an OrganizationScheme. If it is important to retain the affiliation between and individual responsible for the version and his/her agency, a Relation should be created between the individual referenced here and his/her organization. This is primarily intended for internal use."
   "VersionResponsibilityReference_Individual",":doc:`/item-types/Individual/index`","0..1","Reference person or organization within the MaintenanceAgency responsible for the version change, as described in an OrganizationScheme. If it is important to retain the affiliation between and individual responsible for the version and his/her agency, a Relation should be created between the individual referenced here and his/her organization. This is primarily intended for internal use."
   "VersionRationale",":doc:`/composite-types/VersionRationaleType/index`","0..1","Textual description of the rationale/purpose for the version change and a coded value to provide an internal processing flag within and organization or system. Note that versioning can only take place on objects owned by the specified DDI Agency. If you are creating a local instance of an object from another agency for current or future modification use BasedOnObject. If the changes being made result in what you determine to be new object rather than a version of a previous object, i.e. the change is too extensive to consider it a version of the existing object, create a new object and use BasedOnObject to provide a link to the object or objects that were a basis for the new object."
   "BasedOnObject",":doc:`/composite-types/BasedOnObjectType/index`","0..1","Use when creating an object that is based on an existing object or objects that are managed by a different agency or when the new object is NOT simply a version change but you wish to maintain a reference to the object that served as a basis for the new object. BasedOnObject may contain references to any number of objects which serve as a basis for this object, a BasedOnRationalDescription of how the content of the referenced object was incorporated or altered, and a BasedOnRationalCode to allow for specific typing of the BasedOnReference according to an external controlled vocabulary."
   "VersionDate","cogsDate","0..1","Date of version using the union set BaseDateType. Duration should not be used in this field, even though allowed by the ISO format enforced by the parser."
