   "DependentDimension","nonNegativeInteger","0..n","The rank of a dimension that acts as the numerator (dependent variable)."
   "IsNCubeUniverse","boolean","0..1","When true indicates that total count of the NCube as described by the universe acts as the independent variable (denominator) and that all dimensions are used to define the dependent variable (numerator). When false, use the IndependentDimension and DependentDimension elements to assign each rank to its appropriate role."
