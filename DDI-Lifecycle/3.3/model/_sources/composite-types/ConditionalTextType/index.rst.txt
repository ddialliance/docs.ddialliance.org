   :widths: 15,10,5,100

   "Expression",":doc:`/composite-types/CommandCodeType/index`","0..1","The condition on which the associated text varies expressed by a command code. For example, a command that inserts an age by calculating the difference between today’s date and a previously defined date of birth. Use InParameter and OutParameter of parent class to associate Parameters to Alias values in command code."
   "IfThenElseText",":doc:`/composite-types/IfThenElseTextType/index`","0..1","The condition on which the associated text varies expressed by an IfThenElse decision tree. For example, If MEMBER = 1, Then = [ConditionalResult singular], ElseIf MEMBER > 1, Then = [ConditionalResult plural].  Use InParameter and OutParameter of parent class to associate Parameters to Alias values in the IfCondition."
   "SourceParameterReference",":doc:`/composite-types/ParameterType/index`","0..1","This allows for the simple insert of a piece of information from another specified parameter. For example, if the text of the item using conditional text included the respondent’s name use SourceParameterReference to reference the InParameter of the question that is bound to the OutParameter of the question: “What is your name?”"
