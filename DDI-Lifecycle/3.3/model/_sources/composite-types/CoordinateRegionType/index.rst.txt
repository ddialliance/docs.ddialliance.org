   "Label",":doc:`/composite-types/LabelType/index`","0..n","A display label for the CoordinateRegion. Supports multiple language versions of the same content as well as optional formatting of the content. Repeat for labels with different content, for example, labels with differing length limitations."
   "UniverseReference",":doc:`/item-types/Universe/index`","0..n","Reference to the universe statement containing a description of the persons or other elements that this CoordinateRegion refers to, and to which any analytic results refer. If more than one universe is referenced the universe of the CoordinateRegion is the intersect of the referenced universes. Use when the CoordinateRegion describes a subset of the NCube universe."
   "Description",":doc:`/composite-types/StructuredStringType/index`","0..1","A description of the content of the CoordinateRegion. Supports multiple language versions of the same content as well as optional formatting of the content."
   "DimensionValue",":doc:`/composite-types/CohortType/index`","0..n","Defines the included set of values needed to describe the coordinate region of the NCube on a Dimension by Dimension basis."

This may be a legacy ID from DDI-C, a system specific ID such as for a database or registry, or a non-DDI unique identifier. As the identifier is specific to a system the system must be identified with the UserID structure."
   "UserAttributePair",":doc:`/composite-types/StandardKeyValuePairType/index`","0..n","A system specific user defined property of the object expressed as a key/value pair. As this is specific to an individual system the use of controlled vocabularies for the key is strongly recommended."
