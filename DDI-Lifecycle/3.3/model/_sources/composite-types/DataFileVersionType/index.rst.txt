DataFileVersionType
-------------------

Provides the version information for the data file related to this physical instance. Note that while Physical Instance allows for multiple copies of the same data file (such as backup copies) the assumption is that they are identical in terms of content, layout, format and version. The minimum information required is the versionNumber. Additional information on the versionDate, the type of version number when multiple types are supported by an agency, as well as information on VersionResponsibility (inline or by reference) and VersionRationale are available to provide additional information for process tracking and/or informing users of the differences between this and the previous version of the file.
