DataFingerprintType
-------------------

Allows for assigning a hash value (digital fingerprint) to the data or data file. Set the attribute flag to "data" when the hash value provides a digital fingerprint to the data contained in the file regardless of the storage format (ASCII, SAS, binary, etc.). One approach to compute a data fingerprint is the Universal Numerical Fingerprint (UNF). Set the attribute flag to "dataFile" if the digital fingerprint is only for the data file in its current storage format.

   "DigitalFingerprintValue","string","0..1","Contains the value of the specified digital fingerprint."
   "AlgorithmSpecification","string","0..1","Specifies the type of the fingerprint (what algorithm or scheme)."
   "AlgorithmVersion","string","0..1","Contains the version of the algorithm."
   "Type","string","1..1","Brief identification of the type of data fingerprint used. The data fingerprint may be for the data file (storage format specific) or data (format neutral)."
