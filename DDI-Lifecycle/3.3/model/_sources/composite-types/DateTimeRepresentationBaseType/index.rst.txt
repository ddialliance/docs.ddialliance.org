   "DateFieldFormat",":doc:`/composite-types/CodeValueType/index`","0..1","Describes the format of the date field, in formats such as YYYY/MM or MM-DD-YY, etc. If this element is omitted, then the format is assumed to be the XML Schema format corresponding to the type attribute value."
   "DateTypeCode",":doc:`/composite-types/CodeValueType/index`","0..1","This is a standard XML date type code and supports the use of an external controlled vocabulary. Examples are date, dateTime, gYearMonth, gYear, and duration. The DDI Alliance has provided a controlled vocabulary (DateType) to support this element at http://www.ddialliance.org/controlled-vocabularies."
   "Range",":doc:`/composite-types/RangeType/index`","0..n","Indicates the high and low values (endpoints) of a non-numeric scale. This can be expressed as a value that matches the DateTime format. Repeatable in order to express as set of non-continuous values."
   "RegExp","string","0..1","The regular expression allows for further description of the allowable content of the data."

   "RecommendedDataType",":doc:`/composite-types/CodeValueType/index`","0..1","This field provides the recommended treatment of the data within an application. The value should come from a controlled vocabulary - recommended values include the set found in W3C XML Schema Part 2, but excluding string sub-types, QNAME, and NOTATION. The DDI Alliance has provided a controlled vocabulary (DataType) to support this element at http://www.ddialliance.org/controlled-vocabularies."

   "MeasurementUnit",":doc:`/composite-types/CodeValueType/index`","0..1","Records the measurement unit, for example, 'km', 'miles', etc. Supports the use of a controlled vocabulary."
   "MissingValue","string","0..1","List the values used to represent missing data in a space delimited array. Use of MissingValuesReference is preferred. If this content does not match the values provided in the MissingValuesReference, the content of the MissingValuesReference overrides the content of this attribute."
   "BlankIsMissingValue","boolean","0..1","When value is true a blank or empty variable content should be treated as a missing value.  Use of MissingValuesReference is preferred."
   "ClassificationLevel","string","0..1","Indicates the type of relationship, nominal, ordinal, interval, ratio, or continuous. Use where appropriate for the representation type."
