DimensionType
-------------

A dimension is provided a rank and a reference to a variable that describes it. Cell locations are "addressed" by the value of their intersect on each dimension provided in rank order.

   "VariableReference",":doc:`/item-types/Variable/index`","0..1","Identifies the variable describing this dimension. The dimension uses a form of CodeRepresentation (representation uses a CodeList, GeographicStructure, GeographicLocation, etc.), or a fixed range of numeric values to define the labels and intersect points for the dimension. The data set will contain a measurement value for each cell in the NCube rather than specifying the code values of the intersect points on the dimensions. Example: NCube Sex by Age in Years where there are 24 Males Age 4 (Dimension 1 intersect value M, Dimension 2 intersect value 4 with data cell measurement value (count) 24.)"
   "Rank","nonNegativeInteger","1..1","The rank order of this dimension (the order in which the value for this dimension will appear in the cell address)denoted with a 1-based indexing. Provides coordinate order (1,2,n) for the intersect point of this dimension within the cell address. For example, if the rank of this dimension is 2, the intersect point on this dimension will be the second value listed in the cell address."
