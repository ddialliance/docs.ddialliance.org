   "SpecificCellCoordinate","string","0..1","Defines a single cell by its matrix coordinate address. For example ""1,3,2"" for a 3 dimensional matrix where dimension rank-1 has a value of 1, dimension rank-2 has a value of 3, and dimension rank-3 has a value of 2."
   "CellCoordinatesAsDefined",":doc:`/composite-types/CellCoordinatesAsDefinedType/index`","0..1","Defines one or more cells by defining the applicable values of each dimension as ""all values"", a ""specific value"" or a range. For example in a simple 2 dimensional grid where dimension rank-1 is displayed as rows and dimension rank-2 as columns and the first column contains a NumericDomain; SelectDimension rank=""1"" allValues=""true"" and SelectDimension rank=""2"" specificValue=""1"" would result in the NumericDomain being attached to the first column of the grid only."
   "AllCells","boolean","0..1","If the item should be attached to all the cells in the grid set this attribute to ""true""."
