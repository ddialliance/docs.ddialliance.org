GridResponseDomainInMixedType
-----------------------------

Designates the response domain and the cells using the specified response domain within a QuestionGrid. Supports the use of ResponseAttachmentLocation and attachmentBase for defining specific relationships between response domains in a StructuredMixedGridResponseDomain. Functions similar to a ResponseDomainInMixed within a QuestionItem.

   "ResponseDomainReference",":doc:`/item-types/ManagedRepresentation/index`","0..1","The inclusion of a response domain by reference (must be supported by a managed representation). An abstract element. May be substituted by any valid object of substitution type ResponseDomainReference."
   "ResponseAttachmentLocation",":doc:`/composite-types/AttachmentLocationType/index`","0..1","Allows attachment of a secondary response domain to a specific item within another response domain used in the question grid. For example, attach a TextDomain to the value ""Other"" using the TextDomain label (Please specify) as a label for the TextDomain."
   "GridAttachment",":doc:`/composite-types/GridAttachmentType/index`","0..n","Identifies the cell or cells in a grid to which the item is attached by a reference to a specific cell coordinate in a grid or by identifying a range of values along a dimension."
   "AttachmentBase","int","0..1","If another response domain will be attached to the response domain listed withinResponseDomainInMixed provide a value in attachmentBase to allow for unique identification within this question grid. ResponseAttachmentLocation contains an attribute attachmentDomain which will provide a link from the domain that is being attached to the domain it is being attached to."
