GrossFileStructureType
----------------------

Includes information about the file structure, as well as other characteristics that are specific to the physical instance. Information includes place of production, processing checks to validate the content, processing status, the software used to create the data file, and check sums for the number of cases and overall record count.

   "PlaceOfProduction","string","0..1","Indicates the place where the physical instance was produced expressed as a simple string."
   "ProcessingCheck",":doc:`/composite-types/StructuredStringType/index`","0..n","Documents processing checks and other operations performed on the data file. Supports multiple language versions of the same content as well as optional formatting of the content."
   "ProcessingStatus",":doc:`/composite-types/CodeValueType/index`","0..1","Processing status of the data file. Supports the use of an external controlled vocabulary."
   "CreationSoftware",":doc:`/composite-types/SoftwareType/index`","0..1","Indicates the software that was used to create the data file."
   "CaseQuantity","nonNegativeInteger","0..1","Number of cases or observations in the data file. Caution in using optional checksums is recommended. Conflict between checksums and the items being counted can cause problems with warning flags during processing. If using checksum to capture information for internal processing purposes, the use of automatically generated check sums is strongly urged."
   "OverallRecordCount","nonNegativeInteger","0..1","Overall record count in the data file. Caution in using optional checksums is recommended. Conflict between checksums and the items being counted can cause problems with warning flags during processing. If using checksum to capture information for internal processing purposes, the use of automatically generated check sums is strongly urged."

   "UserID",":doc:`/composite-types/UserIDType/index`","0..n","Allows for the specification of identifiers other than the specified DDI identification of the object. This may be a legacy ID from DDI-C, a system specific ID such as for a database or registry, or a non-DDI unique identifier. As the identifier is specific to a system the system must be identified with the UserID structure."
   "UserAttributePair",":doc:`/composite-types/StandardKeyValuePairType/index`","0..n","A system specific user defined property of the object expressed as a key/value pair. As this is specific to an individual system the use of controlled vocabularies for the key is strongly recommended."
