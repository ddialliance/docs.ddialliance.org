GrossRecordStructureType
------------------------

The gross or macro level structures of the record structure including the link to the LogicalRecord and information on the number and ordering of each Physical Segment of the LogicalRecord as stored in the data file. Provides an attribute stating the number of physical segments with a default value of "1".

   "LogicalRecordReference",":doc:`/composite-types/LogicalRecordType/index`","0..1","Reference to the LogicalRecord that describes the record type and intellectual content of the record within the physical data file."
   "PhysicalRecordSegment",":doc:`/composite-types/PhysicalRecordSegmentType/index`","0..n","A description of each physical storage segment required to completely cover the logical record. A logical record may be stored in one or more segments housed hierarchically in a single file or in separate data files. All logical records have at least one segment."
   "NumberOfPhysicalSegments","nonNegativeInteger","0..1","Number of physical records segments each logical record (case) is divided into. Express as an integer. Caution in using checksums is recommended. Conflict between checksums and the items being counted can cause problems with warning flags during processing. If using checksum to capture information for internal processing purposes, the use of automatically generated check sums is strongly urged."

   "UserID",":doc:`/composite-types/UserIDType/index`","0..n","Allows for the specification of identifiers other than the specified DDI identification of the object. This may be a legacy ID from DDI-C, a system specific ID such as for a database or registry, or a non-DDI unique identifier. As the identifier is specific to a system the system must be identified with the UserID structure."
   "UserAttributePair",":doc:`/composite-types/StandardKeyValuePairType/index`","0..n","A system specific user defined property of the object expressed as a key/value pair. As this is specific to an individual system the use of controlled vocabularies for the key is strongly recommended."
