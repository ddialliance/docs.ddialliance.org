IfThenElseTextType
------------------

Describes an if-then-else decision type for conditional text. IF the stated condition is met, the THEN clause is trigged, otherwise the ELSE clause is triggered. Contains an IfCondition (the condition that must be met to trigger the Then clause), a ThenResult (indicating the ConditionalResult to invoke if the condition is met), an ElseResult (indicating the construct to invoke if the condition is not met), and an ElseIfText structure allowing the expression of multiple conditions to invoke multiple branching.
