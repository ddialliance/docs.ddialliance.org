MeasureDefinitionType
---------------------

Defines the structure and type of measure captured within the cells. This may be repeated to describe multiple measure for the cells (i.e., count, percent of universe, dimensional percent, index, text, suppression flag, etc.). Includes a reference to the defining variable and an optional aggregation definition for use in defining content relying on the use of independent and dependent variables (such as the percentage of a specific dimension (like a row or column percent on a table).

   "VariableReference",":doc:`/item-types/Variable/index`","0..1","A reference to the variable that defines the measure of the NCube."
   "AggregationDefinition",":doc:`/composite-types/AggregationDefinitionType/index`","0..1","Identifies the independent (denominator) and dependent (numerator) dimensions for calculating aggregate measures such as percent. When two or more independent or dependent dimensions are listed here, the value is defined as the intersection of the listed dimensions."

This may be a legacy ID from DDI-C, a system specific ID such as for a database or registry, or a non-DDI unique identifier. As the identifier is specific to a system the system must be identified with the UserID structure."
   "UserAttributePair",":doc:`/composite-types/StandardKeyValuePairType/index`","0..n","A system specific user defined property of the object expressed as a key/value pair. As this is specific to an individual system the use of controlled vocabularies for the key is strongly recommended."
