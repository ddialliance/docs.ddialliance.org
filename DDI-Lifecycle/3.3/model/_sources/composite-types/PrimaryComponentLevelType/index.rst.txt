PrimaryComponentLevelType
-------------------------

Provides references to the base level elements that are used as building blocks for composed geographies. For example, Metropolitan areas that are composed of counties except in the New England States where they are composed of county subdivisions, or School Attendance Boundaries (SABINS) built from Census Blocks. This structure allows for specifying the basic building block for composed areas and any restrictions (coverage limitations).
