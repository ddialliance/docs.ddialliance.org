TimeMethodType
--------------

Describes the time method or time dimension of the data collection. This may cover specific timing issues such as when a data collection instrument is fielded (time of year, month, week, day), intended repetition, length of data collection period etc. In addition to the descriptive narrative supports the use of a brief term or external controlled vocabulary to classify the methodology used.

This may be a legacy ID from DDI-C, a system specific ID such as for a database or registry, or a non-DDI unique identifier. As the identifier is specific to a system the system must be identified with the UserID structure."
   "UserAttributePair",":doc:`/composite-types/StandardKeyValuePairType/index`","0..n","A system specific user defined property of the object expressed as a key/value pair. As this is specific to an individual system the use of controlled vocabularies for the key is strongly recommended."
