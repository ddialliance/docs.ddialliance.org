TopicalCoverageType
-------------------

Describes the topical coverage of the module using Subject and Keyword. Note that upper level modules should include all the members of lower level modules. Subjects are members of structured classification systems such as formal subject headings in libraries or topical thesauri. Keywords are generally unstructured and reflect the terminology found in the document and other related (broader or similar) terms.

As the identifier is specific to a system the system must be identified with the UserID structure."
