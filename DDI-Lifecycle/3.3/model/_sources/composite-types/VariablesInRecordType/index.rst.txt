VariablesInRecordType
---------------------

Identifies the variables contained in the logical record by indicating that all variable contained in the logical product are included, inclusion of a scheme of variable to include, or listing individual variables to include. When the attribute allVariablesInLogicalProduct is set to "false" use the VariableSchemeReference (which allows for exclusions) and VariableUsedReference to specify the included variables.
