Archive
-------

A maintainable module containing information related to the archiving (longer term access and/or preservation) of the data and metadata. Note that in DDI Archive refers to a set of processes rather than a location. Archive contents are split into archive specific information (information that is related to the organization or individual performing archival activities) and information that reflects the processes that the metadata or data have undergone which should be maintained along with other content if the metadata changes locations. Two key pieces of information held within the Archive are the Organization Scheme (containing records of Organizations, Individuals, and the Relationships between them) and the Lifecycle. The Lifecycle can be used to document any significant event in the life of the data and metadata. It is a series of Lifecycle Events which note the date of the event, what took place, and who was involved. The module is described by a name, label, and description, archive specific information, an Organization Scheme (in-line or by reference), Lifecycle Information, and Other Materials related to the objects within the Archive Module. Archive Specific information covers details regarding individual items and collections within the archive as well as access conditions, funding and budget information, and quality statements. The reference to the Organization or individual acting as the archive as well as a coverage statement regarding the archive collection is found here.

   "ArchiveModuleName",":doc:`/composite-types/NameType/index`","0..n","A name for the Archive module. May be expressed in multiple languages. Repeat the element to express names with different content, for example different names for different systems."
   "Label",":doc:`/composite-types/LabelType/index`","0..n","A display label for the Archive module. Supports multiple language versions of the same content as well as optional formatting of the content. Repeat for labels with different content, for example, labels with differing length limitations."
   "Description",":doc:`/composite-types/StructuredStringType/index`","0..1","A description of the content and purpose of the Archive module. Supports multiple language versions of the same content as well as optional formatting of the content."
   "ArchiveSpecific",":doc:`/composite-types/ArchiveSpecificType/index`","0..n","Contains metadata specific to a particular archive's holding."
   "OrganizationSchemeReference",":doc:`/item-types/OrganizationScheme/index`","0..n","A list of the organizations related to the DDI instance. This includes information on the archives responsible for creating and maintaining the instance. All agencies must be defined as an Organization in an Archive schema (which can be defined inline or resolved externally)."
   "LifecycleInformation",":doc:`/composite-types/LifecycleInformationType/index`","0..1","LifecycleInformation contains the description of a set of events in the life cycle of the data. It may be extended by specific users."

   "Note",":doc:`/composite-types/NoteType/index`","0..n","Note allows for the attachment of a piece of additional information to any object with an ID. Note facilitates capturing temporary processing notes such as ""Review and approval required"". A single note can be attached to multiple objects by reference to the objects. Note may also contain content for a needed object that has been reported for addition in a later version of the schema. Ideally this should be handled by a local extension, but Note can accommodate run-time extensions when required. The Note should be housed within the Maintainable object that contains the referenced objects. In this way the user is ensured of receiving all known Note attachments when the maintainable content is delivered. This means that if a Note references objects within multiple Maintainable objects, the Note should be repeated in each Maintainable and reference only those objects with that Maintainable."
   "Software",":doc:`/composite-types/SoftwareType/index`","0..n","Indicate the software used to create and/or manage the metadata. This is repeatable to allow for multiple softwares or multiple functions. If this information is important it is advisable to provide it in each maintainable so that it does not become separated from the internal content if the metadata is re-factored."
   "MetadataQuality",":doc:`/composite-types/MetadataQualityType/index`","0..n","An assessment of the quality of the metadata within the Maintainable object, e.g. the quality of the transcription, completeness, editing status, etc."
   "ExternalReferenceDefaultURI","anyURI","0..1","Use to provide a default value for the URI of external references. Use of a URI in a reference within this maintainable overrides the value entered here. Nested maintainables should redeclare the contents of this attribute for clarity."
   "Lang","language","0..1","This is used to designate the language of the metadata content of the maintainable. If a lower level xml:lang attribute conflicts with the content at the maintainable level, the object level value takes precedence."

   "UserID",":doc:`/composite-types/UserIDType/index`","0..n","Allows for the specification of identifiers other than the specified DDI identification of the object. This may be a legacy ID from DDI-C, a system specific ID such as for a database or registry, or a non-DDI unique identifier. As the identifier is specific to a system the system must be identified with the UserID structure."
   "UserAttributePair",":doc:`/composite-types/StandardKeyValuePairType/index`","0..n","A system specific user defined property of the object expressed as a key/value pair. As this is specific to an individual system the use of controlled vocabularies for the key is strongly recommended."
   "VersionResponsibility","string","0..1","Person or organization within the MaintenanceAgency responsible for the version change. If it is important to retain the affiliation between and individual responsible for the version and his/her agency, it may be included in this notation. This is primarily intended for internal use."
   "VersionResponsibilityReference",":doc:`/item-types/Agent/index`","0..1","Reference person or organization within the MaintenanceAgency responsible for the version change, as described in an OrganizationScheme. If it is important to retain the affiliation between and individual responsible for the version and his/her agency, a Relation should be created between the individual referenced here and his/her organization. This is primarily intended for internal use."
   "VersionRationale",":doc:`/composite-types/VersionRationaleType/index`","0..1","Textual description of the rationale/purpose for the version change and a coded value to provide an internal processing flag within and organization or system. Note that versioning can only take place on objects owned by the specified DDI Agency. If you are creating a local instance of an object from another agency for current or future modification use BasedOnObject. If the changes being made result in what you determine to be new object rather than a version of a previous object, i.e. the change is too extensive to consider it a version of the existing object, create a new object and use BasedOnObject to provide a link to the object or objects that were a basis for the new object."
   "BasedOnObject",":doc:`/composite-types/BasedOnObjectType/index`","0..1","Use when creating an object that is based on an existing object or objects that are managed by a different agency or when the new object is NOT simply a version change but you wish to maintain a reference to the object that served as a basis for the new object. BasedOnObject may contain references to any number of objects which serve as a basis for this object, a BasedOnRationalDescription of how the content of the referenced object was incorporated or altered, and a BasedOnRationalCode to allow for specific typing of the BasedOnReference according to an external controlled vocabulary."
   "RelatedOtherMaterialReference",":doc:`/item-types/OtherMaterial/index`","0..n","The inclusion of an existing OtherMaterial by reference. Use for any type of OtherMaterial not specifically addressed by an inline description for such as ExternalAid in QuestionItem."
   "VersionDate","cogsDate","0..1","Date of version using the union set BaseDateType. Duration should not be used in this field, even though allowed by the ISO format enforced by the parser."
   "IsPublished","boolean","0..1","Indicates that the maintainable will not be changed without versioning, and is a stable target for referencing."
