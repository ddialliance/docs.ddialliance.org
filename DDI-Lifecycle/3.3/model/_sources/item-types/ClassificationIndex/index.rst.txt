ClassificationIndex
-------------------

A Classification Index is an ordered list (alphabetical, in code order etc) of Classification Index Entries. A Classification Index can relate to one particular or to several Statistical Classifications. A Classification Index shows the relationship between text found in statistical data sources (responses to survey questionnaires, administrative records) and one or more Statistical Classifications. A Classification Index may be used to assign the codes for Classification Items to observations in statistical collections.

   "ReleaseDate","cogsDate","0..1","Date when the current version of the Classification Index was released."
   "MaintenanceUnitReference",":doc:`/item-types/Agent/index`","0..n","The unit or group of persons within the organization  responsible for the Classification Index, i.e. for adding, changing or deleting Classification Index Entries. TypeOfObject should be set to Organization or Individual"
   "ContactPersonReference",":doc:`/item-types/Agent/index`","0..n"," Person(s) who may be contacted for additional information about the Classification Index. TypeOfObject should be set to Organization or Individual."
   "Publication",":doc:`/composite-types/PublicationType/index`","0..n","A list of the publications in which the Classification Index has been published."
   "Languages","language","0..n","A Classification Index can exist in several languages. Indicates the languages available. If a Classification Index exists in several languages, the number of entries in each language may be different, as the number of terms describing the same phenomenon can change from one language to another. However, the same phenomena should be described in each language. Language is expressed using standard RFC 1766 language codes (for example: fr, en) and may be extended with the use of specific locations (en-UK)."
   "Corrections",":doc:`/composite-types/StructuredStringType/index`","0..1","Summary description of corrections, which have occurred within the Classification Index. Corrections include changing the item code associated with a Classification Index Entry. Supports the use of multiple languages and structured content."
   "CodingInstructions",":doc:`/composite-types/StructuredStringType/index`","0..1","Additional information which drives the coding process for all entries in a Classification Index. Supports the use of multiple languages and structured content."
   "ClassificationIndexEntry",":doc:`/composite-types/ClassificationIndexEntryType/index`","0..n","An ordered list (alphabetical, in code order etc.) of Classification Index Entries."

   "Name",":doc:`/composite-types/NameType/index`","0..n","A name for the item. May be expressed in multiple languages. Repeat the element to express names with different content, for example different names for different systems."
   "Label",":doc:`/composite-types/LabelType/index`","0..n","A display label for the item. May be expressed in multiple languages. Repeat for labels with different content, for example, labels with differing length limitations."
   "Description",":doc:`/composite-types/StructuredStringType/index`","0..1","A description of the content and purpose of the item. May be expressed in multiple languages and supports the use of structured content."

   "Agency","string","1..1",""
   "ID","string","1..1",""
   "Version","string","1..1",""
   "UserID",":doc:`/composite-types/UserIDType/index`","0..n","Allows for the specification of identifiers other than the specified DDI identification of the object. This may be a legacy ID from DDI-C, a system specific ID such as for a database or registry, or a non-DDI unique identifier. As the identifier is specific to a system the system must be identified with the UserID structure."
   "UserAttributePair",":doc:`/composite-types/StandardKeyValuePairType/index`","0..n","A system specific user defined property of the object expressed as a key/value pair. As this is specific to an individual system the use of controlled vocabularies for the key is strongly recommended."
   "VersionResponsibility","string","0..1","Person or organization within the MaintenanceAgency responsible for the version change. If it is important to retain the affiliation between and individual responsible for the version and his/her agency, it may be included in this notation. This is primarily intended for internal use."
   "VersionResponsibilityReference",":doc:`/item-types/Agent/index`","0..1","Reference person or organization within the MaintenanceAgency responsible for the version change, as described in an OrganizationScheme. If it is important to retain the affiliation between and individual responsible for the version and his/her agency, a Relation should be created between the individual referenced here and his/her organization. This is primarily intended for internal use."
   "VersionRationale",":doc:`/composite-types/VersionRationaleType/index`","0..1","Textual description of the rationale/purpose for the version change and a coded value to provide an internal processing flag within and organization or system. Note that versioning can only take place on objects owned by the specified DDI Agency. If you are creating a local instance of an object from another agency for current or future modification use BasedOnObject. If the changes being made result in what you determine to be new object rather than a version of a previous object, i.e. the change is too extensive to consider it a version of the existing object, create a new object and use BasedOnObject to provide a link to the object or objects that were a basis for the new object."
   "BasedOnObject",":doc:`/composite-types/BasedOnObjectType/index`","0..1","Use when creating an object that is based on an existing object or objects that are managed by a different agency or when the new object is NOT simply a version change but you wish to maintain a reference to the object that served as a basis for the new object. BasedOnObject may contain references to any number of objects which serve as a basis for this object, a BasedOnRationalDescription of how the content of the referenced object was incorporated or altered, and a BasedOnRationalCode to allow for specific typing of the BasedOnReference according to an external controlled vocabulary."
   "RelatedOtherMaterialReference",":doc:`/item-types/OtherMaterial/index`","0..n","The inclusion of an existing OtherMaterial by reference. Use for any type of OtherMaterial not specifically addressed by an inline description for such as ExternalAid in QuestionItem."
   "VersionDate","cogsDate","0..1","Date of version using the union set BaseDateType. Duration should not be used in this field, even though allowed by the ISO format enforced by the parser."
   "IsPublished","boolean","0..1","Indicates that the maintainable will not be changed without versioning, and is a stable target for referencing."
