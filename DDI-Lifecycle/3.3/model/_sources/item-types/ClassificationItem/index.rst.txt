ClassificationItem
------------------

A Classification Item represents a Category at a certain Level within a Statistical Classification. It defines the content and the borders of the category. An object/unit can be classified to one and only one Classification Item at each Level of a Statistical Classification.

   "ItemCode","string","0..1","A Classification Item is identified by an alphabetical, numerical or alphanumerical code, which is in line with the code structure of the Level. The code is unique within the Statistical Classification to which the Classification Item belongs."
   "DefiningConceptReference",":doc:`/item-types/Concept/index`","0..n","A concept which describes the Classification Item. TypeOfObject should be set to Concept."
   "Includes",":doc:`/composite-types/StructuredStringType/index`","0..1","Specifies the contents of the category. Supports multiple languages and use of structured content."
   "IncludesAlso",":doc:`/composite-types/StructuredStringType/index`","0..1","A list of borderline cases, which belong to the described category. Supports multiple languages and use of structured content."
   "Excludes",":doc:`/composite-types/StructuredStringType/index`","0..1","A list of borderline cases, which do not belong to the described category. Excluded cases may contain a reference to the Classification Items to which the excluded cases belong. Supports multiple languages and use of structured content."
   "ExcludedClassificationItemReference",":doc:`/item-types/ClassificationItem/index`","0..n","A reference to the Classification Items to which the excluded cases belong. TypeOfObject should be set to ClassificationItem."
   "IsGenerated","boolean","0..1","Indicates whether or not the Classification Item has been generated to make the Level to which it belongs complete."
   "IsValid","boolean","0..1","If updates are allowed in the Statistical Classification, a Classification Item may be restricted in its validity, i.e. it may become valid or invalid after the Statistical Classification has been released. Indicates whether or not the Classification Item is currently valid."
   "ValidFrom","cogsDate","0..1","Date from which the Classification Item became valid. The date must be defined if the Classification Item belongs to a floating Statistical Classification."
   "ValidTo","cogsDate","0..1","Date at which the Classification Item became invalid. The date must be defined if the Classification Item belongs to a floating Statistical Classification and is no longer valid."
   "FutureEvents",":doc:`/composite-types/StructuredStringType/index`","0..1","The future events describe a change (or a number of changes) related to an invalid Classification Item. These changes may e.g. have turned the now invalid Classification Item into one or several successor Classification Items. In describing these changes, terminology from the Typology of item changes, found in Appendix 3 should be used. This allows the possibility to follow successors of the Classification Item in the future. Supports the use of multiple languages and structured content."
   "SuccessorClassificationItemReference",":doc:`/item-types/ClassificationItem/index`","0..n","Future events may e.g. have turned the now invalid Classification Item into one or several successor Classification Items, listed here. TypeOfObject should be set to ClassificationItem."
   "ChangesFromPriorVersion",":doc:`/composite-types/StructuredStringType/index`","0..1","Describes the changes, which the Classification Item has been subject to from the previous version to the actual Statistical Classification. In describing these changes, terminology from the Typology of item changes, found in Appendix 3 of GSIM should be used. Supports the use of multiple languages and structured content."
   "Updates",":doc:`/composite-types/StructuredStringType/index`","0..1","Describes the changes, which the Classification Item has been subject to during the life time of the actual Statistical Classification. Supports the use of multiple languages and structured content."
   "ParentClassificationItemReference",":doc:`/item-types/ClassificationItem/index`","0..1","The Classification Item at the next higher Level of the Statistical Classification of which the actual Classification Item is a sub item. TypeOfObject should be set to ClassificationItem."
   "CaseLaw",":doc:`/composite-types/CaseLawType/index`","0..n","Refers to one or more case law rulings related to the Classification Item."

   "Name",":doc:`/composite-types/NameType/index`","0..n","A name for the item. May be expressed in multiple languages. Repeat the element to express names with different content, for example different names for different systems."
   "Label",":doc:`/composite-types/LabelType/index`","0..n","A display label for the item. May be expressed in multiple languages. Repeat for labels with different content, for example, labels with differing length limitations."

   "Agency","string","1..1",""
   "ID","string","1..1",""
   "Version","string","1..1",""
   "UserID",":doc:`/composite-types/UserIDType/index`","0..n","Allows for the specification of identifiers other than the specified DDI identification of the object. This may be a legacy ID from DDI-C, a system specific ID such as for a database or registry, or a non-DDI unique identifier. As the identifier is specific to a system the system must be identified with the UserID structure."
   "UserAttributePair",":doc:`/composite-types/StandardKeyValuePairType/index`","0..n","A system specific user defined property of the object expressed as a key/value pair. As this is specific to an individual system the use of controlled vocabularies for the key is strongly recommended."
   "VersionResponsibility","string","0..1","Person or organization within the MaintenanceAgency responsible for the version change. If it is important to retain the affiliation between and individual responsible for the version and his/her agency, it may be included in this notation. This is primarily intended for internal use."
   "VersionResponsibilityReference",":doc:`/item-types/Agent/index`","0..1","Reference person or organization within the MaintenanceAgency responsible for the version change, as described in an OrganizationScheme. If it is important to retain the affiliation between and individual responsible for the version and his/her agency, a Relation should be created between the individual referenced here and his/her organization. This is primarily intended for internal use."
   "VersionRationale",":doc:`/composite-types/VersionRationaleType/index`","0..1","Textual description of the rationale/purpose for the version change and a coded value to provide an internal processing flag within and organization or system. Note that versioning can only take place on objects owned by the specified DDI Agency. If you are creating a local instance of an object from another agency for current or future modification use BasedOnObject. If the changes being made result in what you determine to be new object rather than a version of a previous object, i.e. the change is too extensive to consider it a version of the existing object, create a new object and use BasedOnObject to provide a link to the object or objects that were a basis for the new object."
   "BasedOnObject",":doc:`/composite-types/BasedOnObjectType/index`","0..1","Use when creating an object that is based on an existing object or objects that are managed by a different agency or when the new object is NOT simply a version change but you wish to maintain a reference to the object that served as a basis for the new object. BasedOnObject may contain references to any number of objects which serve as a basis for this object, a BasedOnRationalDescription of how the content of the referenced object was incorporated or altered, and a BasedOnRationalCode to allow for specific typing of the BasedOnReference according to an external controlled vocabulary."
   "RelatedOtherMaterialReference",":doc:`/item-types/OtherMaterial/index`","0..n","The inclusion of an existing OtherMaterial by reference. Use for any type of OtherMaterial not specifically addressed by an inline description for such as ExternalAid in QuestionItem."
   "VersionDate","cogsDate","0..1","Date of version using the union set BaseDateType. Duration should not be used in this field, even though allowed by the ISO format enforced by the parser."
   "IsPublished","boolean","0..1","Indicates that the maintainable will not be changed without versioning, and is a stable target for referencing."
