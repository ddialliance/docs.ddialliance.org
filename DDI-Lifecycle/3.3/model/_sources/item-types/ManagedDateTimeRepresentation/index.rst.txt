ManagedDateTimeRepresentation
-----------------------------

Means of describing DateTime so that they can be reused by multiple variables or questions/question constructs. Regardless of the format of the data the content may be treated as a date and or time and converted to ISO standard structure if sufficient information is supplied. In addition to the name, label, and description of the representation, the structure provides the DateField Format, a DateTypeCode and a regular expression for further defining allowed content. The DDI Alliance has provided a controlled vocabulary (DateType) to support this element at http://www.ddialliance.org/controlled-vocabularies.

   "ManagedDateTimeRepresentationName",":doc:`/composite-types/NameType/index`","0..n","A name for the ManagedDateTimeRepresentation. May be expressed in multiple languages. Repeat the element to express names with different content, for example different names for different systems."
   "Label",":doc:`/composite-types/LabelType/index`","0..n","A display label for the ManagedDateTimeRepresentation. Supports multiple language versions of the same content as well as optional formatting of the content. Repeat for labels with different content, for example, labels with differing length limitations."
   "Description",":doc:`/composite-types/StructuredStringType/index`","0..1","A description of the content and purpose of the ManagedDateTimeRepresentation. Supports multiple language versions of the same content as well as optional formatting of the content."
   "RecommendedDataType",":doc:`/composite-types/CodeValueType/index`","0..1","This field provides the recommended treatment of the data within an application. The value should come from a controlled vocabulary - recommended values include the set found in W3C XML Schema Part 2, but excluding string sub-types, QNAME, and NOTATION. The DDI Alliance has provided a controlled vocabulary (DataType) to support this element at http://www.ddialliance.org/controlled-vocabularies."
   "GenericOutputFormat",":doc:`/composite-types/CodeValueType/index`","0..1","This field provides a recommended generic treatment of the data for display by an application. The value should come from a controlled vocabulary."
   "DateFieldFormat",":doc:`/composite-types/CodeValueType/index`","0..1","Describes the format of the date field, in formats such as YYYY/MM or MM-DD-YY, etc. If this element is omitted, then the format is assumed to be the XML Schema format corresponding to the type attribute value."
   "DateTypeCode",":doc:`/composite-types/CodeValueType/index`","0..1","This is a standard XML date type code and supports the use of an external controlled vocabulary. Examples are date, dateTime, gYearMonth, gYear, and durationThe DDI Alliance has provided a controlled vocabulary (DataType) to support this element at http://www.ddialliance.org/controlled-vocabularies."
   "Range",":doc:`/composite-types/RangeType/index`","0..n","Indicates the high and low values (endpoints) of a non-numeric scale. This can be expressed as a value that matches the DateTime format. Repeatable in order to express as set of non-continuous values."
   "RegExp","string","0..1","The regular expression allows for further description of the allowable content of the data."
   "ClassificationLevel","string","0..1","Indicates the type of relationship, nominal, ordinal, interval, ratio, or continuous. Use where appropriate for the representation type."

   "Agency","string","1..1",""
   "ID","string","1..1",""
   "Version","string","1..1",""
   "UserID",":doc:`/composite-types/UserIDType/index`","0..n","Allows for the specification of identifiers other than the specified DDI identification of the object. This may be a legacy ID from DDI-C, a system specific ID such as for a database or registry, or a non-DDI unique identifier. As the identifier is specific to a system the system must be identified with the UserID structure."
   "UserAttributePair",":doc:`/composite-types/StandardKeyValuePairType/index`","0..n","A system specific user defined property of the object expressed as a key/value pair. As this is specific to an individual system the use of controlled vocabularies for the key is strongly recommended."
   "VersionResponsibility","string","0..1","Person or organization within the MaintenanceAgency responsible for the version change. If it is important to retain the affiliation between and individual responsible for the version and his/her agency, it may be included in this notation. This is primarily intended for internal use."
   "VersionResponsibilityReference",":doc:`/item-types/Agent/index`","0..1","Reference person or organization within the MaintenanceAgency responsible for the version change, as described in an OrganizationScheme. If it is important to retain the affiliation between and individual responsible for the version and his/her agency, a Relation should be created between the individual referenced here and his/her organization. This is primarily intended for internal use."
   "VersionRationale",":doc:`/composite-types/VersionRationaleType/index`","0..1","Textual description of the rationale/purpose for the version change and a coded value to provide an internal processing flag within and organization or system. Note that versioning can only take place on objects owned by the specified DDI Agency. If you are creating a local instance of an object from another agency for current or future modification use BasedOnObject. If the changes being made result in what you determine to be new object rather than a version of a previous object, i.e. the change is too extensive to consider it a version of the existing object, create a new object and use BasedOnObject to provide a link to the object or objects that were a basis for the new object."
   "BasedOnObject",":doc:`/composite-types/BasedOnObjectType/index`","0..1","Use when creating an object that is based on an existing object or objects that are managed by a different agency or when the new object is NOT simply a version change but you wish to maintain a reference to the object that served as a basis for the new object. BasedOnObject may contain references to any number of objects which serve as a basis for this object, a BasedOnRationalDescription of how the content of the referenced object was incorporated or altered, and a BasedOnRationalCode to allow for specific typing of the BasedOnReference according to an external controlled vocabulary."
   "RelatedOtherMaterialReference",":doc:`/item-types/OtherMaterial/index`","0..n","The inclusion of an existing OtherMaterial by reference. Use for any type of OtherMaterial not specifically addressed by an inline description for such as ExternalAid in QuestionItem."
   "VersionDate","cogsDate","0..1","Date of version using the union set BaseDateType. Duration should not be used in this field, even though allowed by the ISO format enforced by the parser."
   "IsPublished","boolean","0..1","Indicates that the maintainable will not be changed without versioning, and is a stable target for referencing."
