ManagedNumericRepresentation
----------------------------

A means of capturing a managed representation of a numbers (item that are analyzed as numbers) which can be referenced by a variable or question and used as a value representation or response domain. In addition to the name, label, and description of the managed numeric representation, the structure defines the number range of valid values, plus information on the format, scale, number of decimals, and intervals between valid responses within the range.

   "ManagedNumericRepresentationName",":doc:`/composite-types/NameType/index`","0..n","A name for the ManagedNumericRepresentation. May be expressed in multiple languages. Repeat the element to express names with different content, for example different names for different systems."
   "Label",":doc:`/composite-types/LabelType/index`","0..n","A display label for the ManagedNumericRepresentation. Supports multiple language versions of the same content as well as optional formatting of the content. Repeat for labels with different content, for example, labels with differing length limitations."
   "Description",":doc:`/composite-types/StructuredStringType/index`","0..1","A description of the content and purpose of the ManagedNumericRepresentation. Supports multiple language versions of the same content as well as optional formatting of the content."
   "RecommendedDataType",":doc:`/composite-types/CodeValueType/index`","0..1","This field provides the recommended treatment of the data within an application. The value should come from a controlled vocabulary - recommended values include the set found in W3C XML Schema Part 2, but excluding string sub-types, QNAME, and NOTATION. The DDI Alliance has provided a controlled vocabulary (DataType) to support this element at http://www.ddialliance.org/controlled-vocabularies."
   "GenericOutputFormat",":doc:`/composite-types/CodeValueType/index`","0..1","This field provides a recommended generic treatment of the data for display by an application. The value should come from a controlled vocabulary."
   "NumberRange",":doc:`/composite-types/NumberRangeType/index`","0..n","Defines the valid number range or number values for the representation."
   "NumericTypeCode",":doc:`/composite-types/CodeValueType/index`","0..1","Identification of the numeric type such as integer, decimal, etc. supports the use of an external controlled vocabulary. The DDI Alliance has provided a controlled vocabulary (NumericType) to support this element at http://www.ddialliance.org/controlled-vocabularies."
   "Format","string","0..1","A format for number expressed as a string."
   "Scale","int","0..1","The scale of the number expressed as an integer (for example a number expressed in 100's, 5 = 500 would have a scale of 100)."
   "DecimalPositions","int","0..1","The number of decimal positions expressed as an integer (precision of the number)."
   "Interval_IntervalType","nonNegativeInteger","0..1","The interval between valid responses expressed as an integer."
   "ClassificationLevel","string","0..1","Indicates the type of relationship, nominal, ordinal, interval, ratio, or continuous. Use where appropriate for the representation type."
   "Accuracy","decimal","0..1","The level to which a number is considered to be accurate. Expressed as a decimal. "

   "Agency","string","1..1",""
   "ID","string","1..1",""
   "Version","string","1..1",""
   "UserID",":doc:`/composite-types/UserIDType/index`","0..n","Allows for the specification of identifiers other than the specified DDI identification of the object. This may be a legacy ID from DDI-C, a system specific ID such as for a database or registry, or a non-DDI unique identifier. As the identifier is specific to a system the system must be identified with the UserID structure."
   "UserAttributePair",":doc:`/composite-types/StandardKeyValuePairType/index`","0..n","A system specific user defined property of the object expressed as a key/value pair. As this is specific to an individual system the use of controlled vocabularies for the key is strongly recommended."
   "VersionResponsibility","string","0..1","Person or organization within the MaintenanceAgency responsible for the version change. If it is important to retain the affiliation between and individual responsible for the version and his/her agency, it may be included in this notation. This is primarily intended for internal use."
   "VersionResponsibilityReference",":doc:`/item-types/Agent/index`","0..1","Reference person or organization within the MaintenanceAgency responsible for the version change, as described in an OrganizationScheme. If it is important to retain the affiliation between and individual responsible for the version and his/her agency, a Relation should be created between the individual referenced here and his/her organization. This is primarily intended for internal use."
   "VersionRationale",":doc:`/composite-types/VersionRationaleType/index`","0..1","Textual description of the rationale/purpose for the version change and a coded value to provide an internal processing flag within and organization or system. Note that versioning can only take place on objects owned by the specified DDI Agency. If you are creating a local instance of an object from another agency for current or future modification use BasedOnObject. If the changes being made result in what you determine to be new object rather than a version of a previous object, i.e. the change is too extensive to consider it a version of the existing object, create a new object and use BasedOnObject to provide a link to the object or objects that were a basis for the new object."
   "BasedOnObject",":doc:`/composite-types/BasedOnObjectType/index`","0..1","Use when creating an object that is based on an existing object or objects that are managed by a different agency or when the new object is NOT simply a version change but you wish to maintain a reference to the object that served as a basis for the new object. BasedOnObject may contain references to any number of objects which serve as a basis for this object, a BasedOnRationalDescription of how the content of the referenced object was incorporated or altered, and a BasedOnRationalCode to allow for specific typing of the BasedOnReference according to an external controlled vocabulary."
   "RelatedOtherMaterialReference",":doc:`/item-types/OtherMaterial/index`","0..n","The inclusion of an existing OtherMaterial by reference. Use for any type of OtherMaterial not specifically addressed by an inline description for such as ExternalAid in QuestionItem."
   "VersionDate","cogsDate","0..1","Date of version using the union set BaseDateType. Duration should not be used in this field, even though allowed by the ISO format enforced by the parser."
   "IsPublished","boolean","0..1","Indicates that the maintainable will not be changed without versioning, and is a stable target for referencing."
