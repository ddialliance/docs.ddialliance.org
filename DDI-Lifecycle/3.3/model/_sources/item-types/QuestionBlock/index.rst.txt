QuestionBlock
-------------

A QuestionBlock is a specific structure used in educational and other types of testing where an object (Stimulus Material) is provided and a set of questions are asked regarding the object. The QuestionBlock generally has related QuestionBlocks that measure similar skills or aptitudes and is used randomly within a set of questionnaires to create multiple versions of a single questionnaire that can be used with large groups for testing purposes. Assembly of the QuestionBlocks into a questionnaire may the result of selection based on an experimental design model. It contains information on what the QuestionBlock is intended to measure, input and output parameters for the QuestionBlock, a description of the stimulus material and the questions related to it, instructions on sequencing and number of allowed responses, references to external aids and instructions, and an estimate of the time needed to complete the question. Note that the QuestionBlock is a reusable format for use in any number of applied uses. External aids, instructions, response sequencing etc. should contain information consistent with the general use of the QuestionBlock (QuestionItems and QuestionGrids will contain information specific to the individual question). Additional materials and information can be added within the QuestionConstruct which is the applied use of a question.

   "QuestionBlockName",":doc:`/composite-types/NameType/index`","0..n","A name for the QuestionBlock. May be expressed in multiple languages. Repeat the element to express names with different content, for example different names for different systems."
   "Label",":doc:`/composite-types/LabelType/index`","0..n","A display label for the QuestionBlock. Supports multiple language versions of the same content as well as optional formatting of the content. Repeat for labels with different content, for example, labels with differing length limitations."

   "Binding",":doc:`/composite-types/BindingType/index`","0..n","A structure used to bind the content of a parameter declared as the source to a parameter declared as the target. For example, binding the OutParameter of one Question to the InParameter of another Question in order to personalize a question text. Care should be taken to bind only reusable information at this level. Binding is also available at the QuestionConstruct to reflect bindings particular to the use of the question in a specific question flow or instrument."
   "QuestionBlockIntent",":doc:`/composite-types/StructuredStringType/index`","0..1","The purpose of the QuestionBlock in terms of what it is designed to test. May contain information on specific aspects of the Block and its construction. Supports multiple language versions of the same content as well as optional formatting of the content."
   "StimulusMaterial",":doc:`/composite-types/StimulusMaterialType/index`","0..1","Material that is visual, verbal and/or auditory used to communicate ideas or information which can be researched or provide a source for a response. For example, a picture about which a number of questions are asked, or a sound for which a measurable response is taken (as in a hearing test)."
   "QuestionItemReference",":doc:`/item-types/QuestionItem/index`","0..1","Reference to a QuestionItem containing a question regarding the stimulus material."
   "QuestionGridReference",":doc:`/item-types/QuestionGrid/index`","0..1","Reference to a QuestionGrid containing a question regarding the stimulus material."
   "QuestionSequence",":doc:`/composite-types/QuestionSequenceType/index`","0..1","Allows for recommending that the sequence of questions should vary according to a specified pattern, i.e., random, rotation, etc."
   "ResponseCardinality",":doc:`/composite-types/ResponseCardinalityType/index`","0..1","Indicates the minimum and maximum number of responses to expect from the QuestionBlock."
   "ConceptReference",":doc:`/item-types/Concept/index`","0..n","A reference to the concept the QuestionBlock is intended to gather data on."
   "ExternalAid",":doc:`/composite-types/ExternalAidType/index`","0..n","A pointer to an external aid presented by the instrument such as a text card, image, audio, or audiovisual aid. Typically a URN. Use type attribute to describe the type of external aid provided. Example of terms to use would include: imageOnly audioOnly audioVisual multiMedia."
   "ExternalInterviewerInstruction",":doc:`/composite-types/ExternalInterviewerInstructionType/index`","0..1","External reference to an interviewer instruction not expressed as DDI XML using OtherMaterial."
   "InterviewerInstructionReference",":doc:`/item-types/Instruction/index`","0..1","Reference to an interviewer instruction expressed as DDI XML."
   "EstimatedSecondsResponseTime","decimal","0..1","The estimated amount of time required to answer a question expressed in seconds. Decimal values should be used to define fractions of seconds."

   "UserID",":doc:`/composite-types/UserIDType/index`","0..n","Allows for the specification of identifiers other than the specified DDI identification of the object. This may be a legacy ID from DDI-C, a system specific ID such as for a database or registry, or a non-DDI unique identifier. As the identifier is specific to a system the system must be identified with the UserID structure."
   "UserAttributePair",":doc:`/composite-types/StandardKeyValuePairType/index`","0..n","A system specific user defined property of the object expressed as a key/value pair. As this is specific to an individual system the use of controlled vocabularies for the key is strongly recommended."
   "VersionResponsibility","string","0..1","Person or organization within the MaintenanceAgency responsible for the version change. If it is important to retain the affiliation between and individual responsible for the version and his/her agency, it may be included in this notation. This is primarily intended for internal use."
   "VersionResponsibilityReference",":doc:`/item-types/Agent/index`","0..1","Reference person or organization within the MaintenanceAgency responsible for the version change, as described in an OrganizationScheme. If it is important to retain the affiliation between and individual responsible for the version and his/her agency, a Relation should be created between the individual referenced here and his/her organization. This is primarily intended for internal use."
   "VersionRationale",":doc:`/composite-types/VersionRationaleType/index`","0..1","Textual description of the rationale/purpose for the version change and a coded value to provide an internal processing flag within and organization or system. Note that versioning can only take place on objects owned by the specified DDI Agency. If you are creating a local instance of an object from another agency for current or future modification use BasedOnObject. If the changes being made result in what you determine to be new object rather than a version of a previous object, i.e. the change is too extensive to consider it a version of the existing object, create a new object and use BasedOnObject to provide a link to the object or objects that were a basis for the new object."
   "BasedOnObject",":doc:`/composite-types/BasedOnObjectType/index`","0..1","Use when creating an object that is based on an existing object or objects that are managed by a different agency or when the new object is NOT simply a version change but you wish to maintain a reference to the object that served as a basis for the new object. BasedOnObject may contain references to any number of objects which serve as a basis for this object, a BasedOnRationalDescription of how the content of the referenced object was incorporated or altered, and a BasedOnRationalCode to allow for specific typing of the BasedOnReference according to an external controlled vocabulary."
   "RelatedOtherMaterialReference",":doc:`/item-types/OtherMaterial/index`","0..n","The inclusion of an existing OtherMaterial by reference. Use for any type of OtherMaterial not specifically addressed by an inline description for such as ExternalAid in QuestionItem."
