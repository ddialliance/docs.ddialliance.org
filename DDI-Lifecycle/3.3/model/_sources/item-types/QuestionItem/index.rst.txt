QuestionItem
------------

Structure a single Question which may contain one or more response domains (i.e., a list of valid category responses where if "Other" is indicated a text response can be used to specify the intent of "Other"). The structure provides detail on the intent of the question, the text of the question, the valid response options and the number of allowed responses, references to external aids and instructions, and an estimation of the time needed to respond to the question. Note that the QuestionItem is a reusable format for use in any number of applied uses. External aids, instructions, response sequencing etc. should contain information consistent with the general use of the QuestionItem. Additional materials and information can be added within the QuestionConstruct which is the applied use of a question.

   "QuestionItemName",":doc:`/composite-types/NameType/index`","0..n","A name for the QuestionItem. May be expressed in multiple languages. Repeat the element to express names with different content, for example different names for different systems."
   "Label",":doc:`/composite-types/LabelType/index`","0..n","A display label for the QuestionItem. Supports multiple language versions of the same content as well as optional formatting of the content. Repeat for labels with different content, for example, labels with differing length limitations."
   "Description",":doc:`/composite-types/StructuredStringType/index`","0..1","A description of the QuestionItem. Supports multiple language versions of the same content as well as optional formatting of the content."
   "InParameter",":doc:`/composite-types/InParameterType/index`","0..n","Provides an identity for input objects required for the QuestionItem."
   "OutParameter",":doc:`/composite-types/ParameterType/index`","0..n","Provides an identify for the output objects of the QuestionItem."
   "Binding",":doc:`/composite-types/BindingType/index`","0..n","A structure used to bind the content of a parameter declared as the source to a parameter declared as the target. For example, binding the OutParameter of one Question to the InParameter of another Question in order to personalize a question text. Care should be taken to bind only reusable information at this level. Binding is also available at the QuestionConstruct to reflect bindings particular to the use of the question in a specific question flow or instrument."
   "QuestionText",":doc:`/composite-types/DynamicTextType/index`","0..n","The text of a question. Supports the use of DynamicText. Note that when using QuestionText, the full QuestionText must be repeated for multi-language versions of the content. Different languages may handle the dynamic portions in different locations and/or with different content. Therefore languages cannot be mixed within a dynamic text except when the full text itself has multiple language sections, for example, a foreign language term in a text. The DisplayText may also be repeated to provide a dynamic and plain text version of the display. This allows for accurate rendering of the QuestionText in a non-dynamic environment like print."
   "QuestionIntent",":doc:`/composite-types/StructuredStringType/index`","0..1","The purpose of the QuestionItem in terms of what it is designed to measure. Supports multiple language versions of the same content as well as optional formatting of the content."
   "ResponseDomain",":doc:`/composite-types/RepresentationType/index`","0..1","Contains a response domain for the question item. Typically used to describe simple response domains (textual, numeric, etc.)."
   "ResponseDomainReference",":doc:`/item-types/ManagedRepresentation/index`","0..1","The inclusion of a response domain by reference (must be supported by a managed representation). An abstract element. May be substituted by any valid object of substitution type ResponseDomainReference."
   "StructuredMixedResponseDomain",":doc:`/composite-types/StructuredMixedResponseDomainType/index`","0..1","Use in cases where the question requires the option for multiple response domains, such as a category response and a text response to specify a value for ""Other"", or when text needs to be inserted before, after, or between response options for the question."
   "ResponseCardinality",":doc:`/composite-types/ResponseCardinalityType/index`","0..1","Allows the designation of the minimum and maximum number of responses allowed for this question. Note that each response domain has its own response cardinality."
   "ConceptReference",":doc:`/item-types/Concept/index`","0..n","A reference to the concept associated with the response to the question."
   "ExternalAid",":doc:`/composite-types/ExternalAidType/index`","0..n","A pointer to an external aid presented by the instrument such as a text card, image, audio, or audiovisual aid. Typically a URN. Use type attribute to describe the type of external aid provided. Example of terms to use would include: imageOnly audioOnly audioVisual multiMedia."
   "ExternalInterviewerInstruction",":doc:`/composite-types/ExternalInterviewerInstructionType/index`","0..1","External reference to an interviewer instruction not expressed as DDI XML using OtherMaterial."
   "InterviewerInstructionReference",":doc:`/item-types/Instruction/index`","0..1","Reference to an interviewer instruction expressed as DDI XML."
   "RepresentedVariableReference",":doc:`/item-types/RepresentedVariable/index`","0..n","Reference to the RepresentedVariable that describes the data to be collected by this question. The RepresentedVariable contains the broad reusable specification of the Variable, i.e., concept, universe, and value representation. When more than one ResponseDomain exists, one RepresentedVariable should be created for each ResponseDomain in the same order as the corresponding ResponseDomain. TypeOfObject should be set to RepresentedVariable."
   "EstimatedSecondsResponseTime","decimal","0..1","The estimated amount of time required to answer a question expressed in seconds. Decimal values should be used to define fractions of seconds."

   "Agency","string","1..1",""
   "ID","string","1..1",""
   "Version","string","1..1",""
   "UserID",":doc:`/composite-types/UserIDType/index`","0..n","Allows for the specification of identifiers other than the specified DDI identification of the object. This may be a legacy ID from DDI-C, a system specific ID such as for a database or registry, or a non-DDI unique identifier. As the identifier is specific to a system the system must be identified with the UserID structure."
   "UserAttributePair",":doc:`/composite-types/StandardKeyValuePairType/index`","0..n","A system specific user defined property of the object expressed as a key/value pair. As this is specific to an individual system the use of controlled vocabularies for the key is strongly recommended."
   "VersionResponsibility","string","0..1","Person or organization within the MaintenanceAgency responsible for the version change. If it is important to retain the affiliation between and individual responsible for the version and his/her agency, it may be included in this notation. This is primarily intended for internal use."
   "VersionResponsibilityReference",":doc:`/item-types/Agent/index`","0..1","Reference person or organization within the MaintenanceAgency responsible for the version change, as described in an OrganizationScheme. If it is important to retain the affiliation between and individual responsible for the version and his/her agency, a Relation should be created between the individual referenced here and his/her organization. This is primarily intended for internal use."
   "VersionRationale",":doc:`/composite-types/VersionRationaleType/index`","0..1","Textual description of the rationale/purpose for the version change and a coded value to provide an internal processing flag within and organization or system. Note that versioning can only take place on objects owned by the specified DDI Agency. If you are creating a local instance of an object from another agency for current or future modification use BasedOnObject. If the changes being made result in what you determine to be new object rather than a version of a previous object, i.e. the change is too extensive to consider it a version of the existing object, create a new object and use BasedOnObject to provide a link to the object or objects that were a basis for the new object."
   "BasedOnObject",":doc:`/composite-types/BasedOnObjectType/index`","0..1","Use when creating an object that is based on an existing object or objects that are managed by a different agency or when the new object is NOT simply a version change but you wish to maintain a reference to the object that served as a basis for the new object. BasedOnObject may contain references to any number of objects which serve as a basis for this object, a BasedOnRationalDescription of how the content of the referenced object was incorporated or altered, and a BasedOnRationalCode to allow for specific typing of the BasedOnReference according to an external controlled vocabulary."
   "RelatedOtherMaterialReference",":doc:`/item-types/OtherMaterial/index`","0..n","The inclusion of an existing OtherMaterial by reference. Use for any type of OtherMaterial not specifically addressed by an inline description for such as ExternalAid in QuestionItem."
