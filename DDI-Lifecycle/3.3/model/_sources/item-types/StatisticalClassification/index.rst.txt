StatisticalClassification
-------------------------

A Statistical Classification is a set of categories which may be assigned to one or more variables registered in statistical surveys or administrative files, and used in the production and dissemination of statistics. The categories at each level of the classification structure must be mutually exclusive and jointly exhaustive of all objects/units in the population of interest. The categories are defined with reference to one or more characteristics of a particular population of units of observation. A Statistical Classification may have a flat, linear structure or may be hierarchically structured, such that all categories at lower Levels are sub-categories of categories at the next Level up. Categories in Statistical Classifications are represented in the information model as Classification Items.

   "DerivedFromReference",":doc:`/item-types/StatisticalClassification/index`","0..1","A Statistical Classification can be derived from one of the classification versions of another Classification Series. The derived Statistical Classification can either inherit the structure of the classification version from which it is derived, usually adding more detail, or use a large part of its Classification Items, rearranging them in a different structure. Indicates the classification version from which the actual Statistical Classification is derived. TypeOfObject should be set to StatisticalClassification."
   "ChangesFromPreceding",":doc:`/composite-types/StructuredStringType/index`","0..1","A summary description of the nature and content of changes from the preceding version or update.

   "PermissibleUpdates",":doc:`/composite-types/StructuredStringType/index`","0..1","If Updates are Allowed, Indicate here what structural changes, if any, are permissible within a version. Note whether Classification Items can be added to the structure and whether they can be revalidated or invalidated. Such changes are more likely to be permissible in floating classifications. Also indicate whether changes to such things as Classification Item names and explanatory notes that do not involve structural changes are permissible within a version. Supports the use of multiple languages and structured content."
   "Updates",":doc:`/composite-types/StructuredStringType/index`","0..1","Summary description of changes which have occurred since the most recent classification version or classification update came into force. Supports the use of multiple languages and structured content."
   "VariantOfReference",":doc:`/item-types/StatisticalClassification/index`","0..1","For those Statistical Classifications that are variants, notes the Statistical Classification on which it is based and any subsequent versions of that Statistical Classification to which it is also applicable. TypeOfObject should be set to StatisticalClassification."
   "VariantChangesFromBase",":doc:`/composite-types/StructuredStringType/index`","0..1","Describes the relationship between the variant and its base Statistical Classification, including regrouping, aggregations added and extensions. Supports the use of multiple languages and structured content."
   "VariantPurpose",":doc:`/composite-types/StructuredStringType/index`","0..1","If the Statistical Classification is a variant, notes the specific purpose for which it was developed. Supports the use of multiple languages and structured content."

This may be a legacy ID from DDI-C, a system specific ID such as for a database or registry, or a non-DDI unique identifier. As the identifier is specific to a system the system must be identified with the UserID structure."
   "UserAttributePair",":doc:`/composite-types/StandardKeyValuePairType/index`","0..n","A system specific user defined property of the object expressed as a key/value pair. As this is specific to an individual system the use of controlled vocabularies for the key is strongly recommended."

   "VersionResponsibilityReference",":doc:`/item-types/Agent/index`","0..1","Reference person or organization within the MaintenanceAgency responsible for the version change, as described in an OrganizationScheme. If it is important to retain the affiliation between and individual responsible for the version and his/her agency, a Relation should be created between the individual referenced here and his/her organization. This is primarily intended for internal use."
   "VersionRationale",":doc:`/composite-types/VersionRationaleType/index`","0..1","Textual description of the rationale/purpose for the version change and a coded value to provide an internal processing flag within and organization or system. Note that versioning can only take place on objects owned by the specified DDI Agency. If you are creating a local instance of an object from another agency for current or future modification use BasedOnObject. If the changes being made result in what you determine to be new object rather than a version of a previous object, i.e. the change is too extensive to consider it a version of the existing object, create a new object and use BasedOnObject to provide a link to the object or objects that were a basis for the new object."
   "BasedOnObject",":doc:`/composite-types/BasedOnObjectType/index`","0..1","Use when creating an object that is based on an existing object or objects that are managed by a different agency or when the new object is NOT simply a version change but you wish to maintain a reference to the object that served as a basis for the new object. BasedOnObject may contain references to any number of objects which serve as a basis for this object, a BasedOnRationalDescription of how the content of the referenced object was incorporated or altered, and a BasedOnRationalCode to allow for specific typing of the BasedOnReference according to an external controlled vocabulary."
   "RelatedOtherMaterialReference",":doc:`/item-types/OtherMaterial/index`","0..n","The inclusion of an existing OtherMaterial by reference. Use for any type of OtherMaterial not specifically addressed by an inline description for such as ExternalAid in QuestionItem."
